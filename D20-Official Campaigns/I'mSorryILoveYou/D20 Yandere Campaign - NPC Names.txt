 When a character is voted out they will be arrested:
 If the arrested Character/Player is the Yandere, Innocents Win

 If the arrested Character/Player is the Yandere's Target (Love interest) then the Innocents lose.

Club Activity - PLAYERS go to the club that they are in. They can not interact with player's or characters outside their club.

 Yandere can not kill their target/love interest.


Behind the scenes:
 innocents can't be told who the Yandere is when selected.
 the yandere is randomly selected at the start of the game and their target (love interest) is given to them.
 the end point of the game is to try to win as the yandere taking your target to the fetival as your date, or as a player by voting out the yandere along side asking someone to the festival.
 Their should be points in time where you can build a connection with other players so after (x) turns you may ask out who you are and if you have a Great-Amazing! connection then that character will go to the festival with you.
 connection raiting should go from "Bad" to "Ok" to "Decent" to "Good" to "Great" to "Amazing!"
 If nobody dies and the Yandere gets their target to go to the festival with them like everyone else, everyone wins and goes to the festival with the character they like.
 Students in the HOMEROOM can only be the Yandere. *Make this An Option to enable before game starts* if disabled any student can be the Yandere.
 Teachers can't be love interests or Yandere.
