        <h3>📖 Campaign Overview</h3>
        <p>In the vast cosmos, music is more than art—it's the fundamental force that holds reality together. 
        The Starlight Symphony, an ancient cosmic orchestra, has maintained universal harmony for eons. 
        But now, the music is fading, and chaos threatens to consume the stars.</p>
        
        <p>As chosen heroes, you must travel through different celestial realms, each resonating with unique 
        musical frequencies. Restore the symphony, defeat the Discord that threatens existence, and become 
        legends sung across the cosmos.</p>
